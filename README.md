# 3D Artist Unity Tools

Random Unity editor scripts I've written to help automate various tasks related to being a 3D artist who wants to reuse scenes and 3D content I've made for one platform, on another.

## Purpose

These scripts solve specific workflow challenges I've encountered when adapting 3D content across different platforms and projects. Rather than letting them collect digital dust, I'm sharing them in case they help other artists facing similar problems.

## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **Use at your own risk** - These scripts are provided as-is without warranty of any kind.

⚠️ **Limited testing** - I have not thoroughly tested these scripts across all Unity versions, platforms, or use cases. They work for my specific workflow but may not work for yours.

⚠️ **No support provided** - I do not provide technical support, troubleshooting, or guarantees that these will work in your environment.

⚠️ **Backup your projects** - Always backup your project before running any editor scripts.
